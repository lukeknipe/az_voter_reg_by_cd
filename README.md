# Arizona's congressional districts, by the numbers
This is a [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) interactive choropleth map of Arizona's nine congressional districts. In varying shades of red and blue, the map shows which 
political party holds the voter registration advantage, and the size of that advantage, in each district according to voter registration data 
[published](https://azsos.gov/sites/default/files/state_voter_registration_2023_july.pdf) by the Arizona Secretary of State. 


On hover, the map displays voter registration statistics for the hovered district, along with some other information. (On mobile devices, where hovering isn't a thing, the 
map will instead do this on a click.)
